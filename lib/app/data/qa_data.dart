      'A feeling of expectation and desire for a particular thing to happen. To be hopeful, is to trust in something.',
      'Should we be hopeful?'
    ],
    'answer': '''Yes and No. 
Hope is an expectation that our prediction will come true. Hope is choosing to ignore reality. Our predictions will not always come true. Hope makes you fail to do something, while waiting for it to happen all by itself. It is a cage put on ourselves by ones self. Accepting that some realities might come true or not, brings forth joy and makes you free. Through this, you become more likely to achieve anything, since you only count on your self. If we are to be hopeful, then it must be in both the positive happening or the negative, which will be impossible. Instead of finding hope we should find motivation.

    'title': 'HEAVEN',
    'question': [
      'a place regarded in various religions as the abode of God (or the gods) and the angels, and of the good after death.',
      'Should we believe in heaven?'
    ],
    'answer':
        ''' Various religions believe that people will go to heaven because of their doings, but not because they believe there is a heaven. This means that if you be good, and you don\\'t necessarily believe there is a heaven, then you will also go to heaven. A child agrees to eat because he is told he will be bought some candy later. This is heaven to him, for it represents a better tomorrow. The problem is, this can be true or false, but it will have made the child eat his breakfast which was the main point.
Heaven is the candy of religion. If they follow through with their beliefs, they will be rewarded. The point of it is to make them live according to certain ways but not to believe in a heaven specifically.
Though this might or might not be true, it leads people to live a life without fulfillment since they will be rewarded in another life. Their life here on earth becomes a bridge to a better life which may or may not happen ans so, many will have wasted their life and not lived it as they would if they didn\\'t believe in another life.
We should always make a Heaven out of this world, for no one knows tomorrow. Be good, and humane so that if you believe in heaven, you will still qualify and you will have lived a fulfilling life here on earth.''',

    'question': [
      'Self-love is a state of appreciation for oneself that grows from actions that support our physical, psychological and spiritual growth.',
      'Of cos we should love ourselves, but Should we love ourselves every time?'
    ],
    'answer':
        '''Just as a parent punishes their child for wrong doing, it is only to make sure that the child doesn't do this again. It is not that they hate them but because of love for them. The same parent rewards their child when he has done something good or an achievement of some kind.
Everyone should love themselves enough to punish themselves when they do wrong, and also love themselves enough to reward when they do a positive thing. The love should not be wavy, but should be constant. It should not be controlled by situations or state of being at a specific time. It should be without no end, for with self love comes self confidence and achievements become unlimited. ''',

    'question': [
      'Love is a great interest and pleasure in something or someone. ',
      'Whats like to love, and who should we love?'
    ],
    'answer':
        '''According to the Greeks, there are seven types of love: Eros (romantic),Philia (friendly), Storge (family unconditional),Agape(selfless/universal),Ludus (playful),Pragma (committed),Philautia (self love).
The first person you should love, is the one who you see every time when you look in the mirror. Who you hear speaking in your mind and who keeps you feel safe.
The second person you love is everyone else. Love brings joy to the world. Where there is Love, there are no wars. There is no hunger nor poverty. That place is the ideal heaven where everything is perfect. Love also leads to continuity of life. Love has no bounds and cannot be limited. It is the only thing that is best when its too much. ''',

    'title': 'STRUGGLE',
    'question': [
      'A struggle is a long and difficult attempt to achieve something.',
      'How to deal with struggle?'
    ],
    'answer':
        ''' From birth, all animals struggle to join life, From the shells birds struggle because nothing just exist without struggle. Even trees once struggled to get out of a seed. Then by all means struggle defines life and death. It decides whether something is to exist or not. Everyone struggles are different. The poor struggle to get food, while the rich struggle to get more profits. A king struggles to lead his subjects while his subjects struggle to pay taxes and serve their leader. Addicts struggle to get out of a certain state and become free from whatever the may be addicted to.
 Although Struggle does not guarantee success, more Struggle increases chances of getting it. The heart struggles to pump until when it gets tired and stops. It is necessary to struggle in life. It cannot be avoided because just like death, struggle is also promised.
If we accept our condition as it is, and are willing to change it then we can be successful in our goals. If we donâ€™t accept this, then our Struggle will be meaningless for in order to struggle to be successful, there must be a change of state involved. Hungry to full, homeless to having a shelter, sick to healthy, poor to rich is all achieved after Struggle. ''',
